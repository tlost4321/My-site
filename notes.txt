Color Schemes:

Prefer Green, White, and Grey.
	Green for main color
	White for text or section color
	Grey preferrably for section color. 
	If white sections will need black text.


BBH photos are Blue, Yellow, and Red.....

Stoner Ranch Photos are Light Grey, Red, and White.

Backgrounds for Sections on Projects will need to be either White or light grey to not complicate. 

Main background could be forest green. Or light leaf green. Need to decide on shape of pages. Or page. 
Do I want a table like Steve's, or one long page like the example I found. 

For project photos, possibly do a slideshow for the pictures....just to add more style. Can make the pictures bigger that way.
The headers can either be laid on top of image and be transparent or can be added underneath. 

NEED TO CROP THE LEFT OF BBH6 AND BBH7.
