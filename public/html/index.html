<div class="xp">
<p>My work experience is heavily filled with Customer Service roles. The places I have gravitated towards later in my experience are companies that have a passion for something. Whether that be helping them find the perfect outfit, or making sure that all of the passengers have a great and safe experience getting to the airport. </p>

<p>The reason I gravitate towards those companies is because I believe that people that have a passion for what they do, do a better job and they have more fun doing it. When the atmosphere is a happy one, everything runs more smooothly. I feel that I am good at creating a happy and relaxing environment with the groups I work with, even in the most stressful of situations.</p>
